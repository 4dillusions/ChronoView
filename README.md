ChronoView is a minimalist photo timeline viewer built with **WinUI 3** and **C# (MVVM pattern)**.  
It lets you explore your images through time — smooth, responsive, and focused on clean UI and intuitive interaction.

## 🕓 Overview

ChronoView visualizes JPEG images from a selected folder along a horizontal timeline.  
Each photo is positioned based on its creation date, allowing you to scroll or zoom through your visual history.  
The main viewer dynamically updates to display the image corresponding to the center point of the timeline.

## 🧠 Concept

ChronoView is a personal exploration of **temporal storytelling through images**.  
It combines simple data binding and reactive UI concepts with a focus on **clean design and user flow**.  
It also serves as a small demonstration of **WinUI + MVVM structure** in a modern desktop context.
