# ChronoView

**ChronoView** is a minimalist photo timeline viewer built with **WinUI 3** and **C# (MVVM pattern)**.  
It lets you explore your images through time — smooth, responsive, and focused on clean UI and intuitive interaction.

ChronoView visualizes JPEG images from a selected folder along a horizontal timeline.  
Each photo is positioned based on its creation date, allowing you to scroll or zoom through your visual history.
